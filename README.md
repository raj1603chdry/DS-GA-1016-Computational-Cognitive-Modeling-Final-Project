# DS-GA-1016-Computational-Cognitive-Modeling-Final-Project

Group project for DS-GA 1016 - Computational Cognitive Modeling (taught by Prof.
Brenden Lake, [course website](https://brendenlake.github.io/CCM-site/) -
NYU Spring 2022)

## Group Members

* Alind Jain (aj2815)
* Raj Choudhary (rc4482)
* Tharangini Sankarnarayanan (ts4180)

## Topic: Neural Networks: Visual Representations

*Selected from [Course webpage](https://brendenlake.github.io/CCM-site/final_project_ideas.html)'s project section*

> **Comparing human and convolutional network representations for images**: With a visual domain of your choice (objects, animals, cars, etc.), use the Peterson et al. (2016) study design to compare the image similarity ratings between people and a pre-trained deep convolutional neural network trained on image recognition (as you did in Homework 1 Part D). Or, using a visual domain of your choice, use the Lake et al. (2015) study design compare typicality ratings between people and a pre-trained deep convolutional neural network trained on image recognition.

## General Guidelines (TBC)

* Do not commit to `main` branch directly. Use custom branches and make pull-requests.
* Each branch name should include its author's name, e.g., `raj-similarity-analysis`.
* After creating a PR, assign all other contributors to approve the PR. Only
merge the PR when it is approved by everyone.
* Only PR comment author may mark the comment as `Resolved`.
* Do not use `git push -f` / `git push --force`.
* `README.md` files for each folder will be updated when the project is
completed.
* All `*.py` and `*.ipynb` files should have the name and email of the author
indicated at the beginning of the file.
* Stick to the general PEP-8 coding style.
* **PLEASE** add comments and document your code.
* Update `.gitignore` with anything that is too large or doesn't need to be
in the Github repo.
* By default, except `README.md` from data, nothing would be pushed to Github. 
If something needs to be on Github, add exception in `.gitignore`.
